# Refresh Tokens

__Refresh tokens_ are special kinds of tokens that your app can use to get renewed `id_token` ([JWT](http://docs.auth0.com/jwt)) **at any time**. A __refresh token__ must be securely stored in your app.

## Introduction

The response of an initial authentication request results in an `id_token` being issued by Auth0. You use this token to authenticate calls to your secured API.

Among other security measures, like signing, every `id_token` has an expiration. By default this is set to 10 hours since issue time, but it can be changed.

Applications that are installed on a device such as a computer, a smartphone or a device might often want to avoid asking the user to enter credetnials each time a token expires.

A `refresh_token` is an artifact that allows the application to request Auth0 to issue a new token. This works as long as the __refresh token__ is not revoked in the server.

Think of a __refresh token__ as a permission to renew tokens indefinitely, until you cancel that permission (which happens when it is __revoked__). When that happens, user will have to login again no matter what.

## Security considerations

Because a __refresh token__ never expires, it is important to provide admins of apps ability to revoke access. Auth0 allows this process to happen both from the dashboard and programmatically through an API.

__Refresh tokens__ are issued for the combination of __App__, __User__ and __Device__. And revocation works on this combinationton too.

## How it all works

The process to log the user in is the same as [explained in the sequence diagram page](https://docs.auth0.com/sequence-diagrams). The difference is that when calling the **`authorize`** endpoint, you must include the **`offline_access`** `scope`. For example:

````
GET https://@@account.namespace@@/authorize/?
    response_type=token
    &client_id=@@account.clientId@@
    &redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL
    &state=VALUE_THAT_SURVIVES_REDIRECTS
    &scope=openid%20offline_access
```

After the user authenticates with the IdP, Auth0 will direct th user to callback URL as usual. The complete URL will look like:

````
GET YOUR_CALLBACK_URL#
    access_token=2YotnF..........1zCsicMWpAA
    &id_token=......Json Web Token......
    &state=VALUE_THAT_SURVIVES_REDIRECTS
    &refresh_token=....The refresh token....
```

This is the same as before but it will now contain a `refresh_token` parameter.

> The token is the URL because the sample `authorize` request used `response_type=token`

Every time you need to get a new `id_token`, you can call the [Delegation endpoint](https://docs.auth0.com/auth-api#!#post--delegation)**

````
POST https://@@account.namespace@@/delegation
Content-Type: 'application/json'
{
  "client_id":       "@@account.clientId",
  "grant_type":      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer",
  "refresh_token":   "your_refresh_token",
  "api_type":        "app"
}
```

## Using it with SDKs

Libraries like `auth0.js`, `auth0-widget.js` or `auth0-angular.js`, all include support to get the `refresh_token`.

You can read more about it in the following links:

* [Getting it with Auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js#login)  and [using it to get a new id_token](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js#refresh-token)
* [Getting it with Auth0-widget.js](https://github.com/auth0/widget#show-widget). Using it is through Auth0.js
* [Getting and using it with Auth0-angular.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/blob/master/docs/refreshToken.md)
